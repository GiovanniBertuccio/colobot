```properties
prog065.txt	Guard program for PhazerShooter. Put it somewhere (preferably high), activate it and watch it never miss moving targets up to 80 meters away.	PhazerShooter	vuurmeester@hotmail.com
prog064.txt	FieldRefuel -- The purpose of this program is to extend the range of attack bots. It takes them too much energy to get out in the field to have to go back and refuel, so I just let them run as they will and have this program running on a dedicated bot all the time.	WingedGrabber	giga@netzero.net
prog063.txt	Safe Cracker !	Any	RossK_wc2@hotmail.com
prog062.txt	Run this program and 10 ants surround your SpaceShip - don't be afraid, these are tame as sheep. They'll meet around and then go mind their own business elsewhere. Rename this program as "Society.txt" and copy to BOTH directories, "program" and "script". Bring them as pets to 1st Moon scenario, these ants *love* TitaniumOre.	Any	sgirbau@numen.es
prog061.txt	All unit's speeds	All	pmnox@astermedia.pl
prog060.txt	Improved ant killing program. Only big bug is following: when started on mountin it will maybe do nothing-manualy led this bot to nearest flat surface(altitude 0-5). It has lot of bugs, but not important. Tested on tropiva and Saari demo.	WingedShooters	ohrusk@seznam.cz
prog059.txt	New version bug fixed. Now work better.	All	pmnox@astermedia.pl

Every thing you ever wanted to find in colobot, you can use your radar to find ANYTHING in the game; plants, bots, items, ruins, etc… I also have listed the dimensions of every object, the height and the radius. I also included all the programs I wrote to help me find this data. Enjoy!	All	RossK_WC2@hotmail.com

prog056.txt	This is my version of radar, now you can look everywhere on map, even if you don't have radar builded.	All	pmnox@astermedia.pl
prog055.txt	This program is intended to help tower recharge problem. With this program WeeledGrabber (also TrackedGrabber) will stay and scan power levels of Towers. If power falls below 1/3rd it will move to the tower, take empty cell, put a full one into it and take the empty cell to the Power station to recharge. This program can serve many towers. Tested on 3 towers ;-)	WheeledGrabber and TrackedGrabber	roberts83@navigators.lv

Also, if a power station is in the level, it recharges a power cell to put in the bot.	All grabbers	JordanMW11@hotmail.com

prog046.txt	This is cybernetic aiming program. It allows you to manually pilot a shooter and then fire with computer accuracy. Run this program rather than hit the fire button when manually controlling a shooter or orgashooter. This is a modification of code fragments from the alienkiller program made by Yenz. Pitch correction helps aiming in non-winged bots.	All shooters	daniel_newman@email.com
prog045.txt	A cool repair program for Shielder. It will repair all buidings and bots. Good if you want to quickly repair entire base tedious-free.	Shielder	thomasnguyen1234@yahoo.com

prog036.txt	My new attack program. Aiming and enemy seeking has been improved. It works with all shooters (legged, winged, etc.) against all enemy races (ant, wasp, etc.).

prog031.txt	This program is my improved tower cell changer. It works for all your towers with a single robot, and the towers have very little down time (maybe 10 seconds), Requres one Energy cell above 80% in a 400 Meter radius to work properly. Nuclear or regular.	All non-flying grabbers	mburkart@home.com
prog030.txt	This is my hunter killer progam. It is specificly designed for ground based things however it could be modified to include flying things.

prog015.txt	Hunts ants. Only lands when it has to, shoots ants without stoping or landing. Also returns to base for power and health as needed.	WingedShooter	NeBan@triad.rr.com
prog014.txt	This is a rough stab (my first) at a WingedShooter program, and it seems to work fairly well on the last mission of the demo (ants on the hill one).
